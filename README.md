## Features and Application Demonstration
- `Feature 1`: The page was not created responsively per se; however, it was developed using REM values, which still makes the page more organized when viewed on smaller devices, as the elements automatically shrink or enlarge accordingly.
- `Feature 2`: Creation of an input for registration to receive email notifications about available job vacancies if desired.
- `Feature 3`: Development in sections, separating them in an organized and easily maintainable code manner.
